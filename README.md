# Vanilla JavaScript Game Template

A lightweight template for building a **3D game using vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks), focused on clarity, extensibility, and learning-by-modifying.

Note: The app should run on any version of Python but python3.11 is the most tried and true.

## 📚 Documentation

Start here to understand and customize the game:

- **`GameCoreDoc.md`**  
  Core engine overview, helper functions, and how the game loop works (`start()` vs `update()`).

- **`GameCoreCharacterAnimationGuide.md`**  
  Step-by-step guide for replacing the player character using **Tinkercad → Mixamo**, including rigging, animations, and FBX setup.

- **`GameCoreConfigsDoc.md`**  
  Complete reference for all `CONFIG` variables, what they do, and how changing them affects gameplay and feel.

Each document is designed to be read independently, but together they explain:
- how the engine is structured
- how assets and animations are loaded
- how to tune movement, camera, climbing, and physics
- how to safely customize the game without breaking the core loop
